## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
  The project is an online bug tracking system for projects. The application allows software testers to report bugs for a project, project managers to view all bugs, assign bugs to developers and developers to update the bug status.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

NOTE: This is a monorepo, with the backend and frontend in separate submodules. The backend is a spring boot application and the frontend is a htmls/css/js application.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your machine:

```
open-jdk 22
mysql 8.0
maven 3.6.3
```


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Clone the complete project using the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hugs-for-bugs-codefury/bug-tracking-system.git
```

Or if you have ssh setup with github, you can use the following command:
    
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:hugs-for-bugs-codefury/bug-tracking-system.git
```

## 🚀 Setting Up <a name = "setting-up"></a>

Find the README.md files in the backend and frontend submodules for instructions on setting up the backend and frontend respectively.
